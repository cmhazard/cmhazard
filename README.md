### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am an early-stage venture capitalist investing in pre-seed and seed-stage companies with a particular focus on companies that go to market via developers. I began my career at Greylock in 1994 and in 2002 I co-founded	[Flybridge](https://www.flybridge.com).  In 2017, I also co-founded [XFactor Ventures](https://xfactor.ventures), which focuses on investing in companies founded by women.  In 2021, I was named to the Insider Seed 100 list of the best early-stage investors.

Since 2009, I have served on the Board of Directors at [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) where I have been part of the company's growth from five employees and no revenue to over 5,000 employees and over $1.6 billion in revenue. I was also the Seed and Series A investor at [Firebase](https://www.firebase.google.com/) prior to its acquisition by Google.  I am also currently an investor, board member, or advisor in companies including [@Appwrite](https://github.com/appwrite), [Aiera](https://www.aiera.com), [Alloy Enterprises](https://www.alloyenterprises.co), [Avala](https://www.avala.ai/), [Blaze](https://www.blaze.tech), [Coherence](https://www.withcoherence.com/), [Constructor](https://constructor.dev/), [Decipad](https://www.decipad.com/), [First Party](https://www.firstpartyhq.com), [Glimpse](https://www.glimpse.engineering/), [Looka](https://looka.com/), [Metaplane](https://www.metaplane.dev), [Nasuni](https://www.nasuni.com), [NuMind](https://www.numind.ai/), [Parachute](https://www.parachutehome.com), [Proscia](https://proscia.com/), [Redox](https://www.redoxengine.com), [Rezonate](https://www.rezonate.io/), [Scitara](https://www.scitara.com), [Shortwave](https://www.shortwave.com/), [Stackhawk](https://www.stackhawk.com), [Storetasker](https://www.storetasker.com), and [Trackd](https://www.trackd.com/). I work closely with founders on growing as leaders, organizational development, product strategy, go-to-market playbooks, and financing strategy and can do so from the start of the entrepreneurial journey to significant scale and success. Outside of my day job, I am the Chair of the Board at [Horizons for Homeless Children](https://horizonschildren.org/).
