### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am an early-stage venture capitalist investing in pre-seed and seed-stage companies with a particular focus on companies that go to market via developers. I began my career at Greylock in 1994 and in 2002 I co-founded	[Flybridge](https://www.flybridge.com).  In 2017, I also co-founded [XFactor Ventures](https://xfactor.ventures), which focuses on investing in companies founded by women.  In 2021, I was named to the Insider Seed 100 list of the best early-stage investors

Since 2009, I have served on the Board of Directors at [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) and am also currently an investor, board member, or advisor in companies including [@Appwrite](https://github.com/appwrite), [Aiera](https://www.aiera.com), [Avala](https://www.avala.ai/), [Blaze](https://www.blaze.tech), [Coherence](https://www.withcoherence.com/), [Constructor](https://constructor.dev/), [Decipad](https://www.decipad.com/), [Deep Channel](https://www.deepchannel.com/), [First Party](https://www.firstpartyhq.com), [Looka](https://looka.com/), [Metaplane](https://www.metaplane.dev), [Nasuni](https://www.nasuni.com), [Parachute](https://www.parachutehome.com), [Proscia](https://proscia.com/), [Redox](https://www.redoxengine.com), [Scitara](https://www.scitara.com), [Shortwave](https://www.shortwave.com/), [Stackhawk](https://www.stackhawk.com), and [Storetasker](https://www.storetasker.com).
